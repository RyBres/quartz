**Law of Total Probability**
If $A_1,...A_n$ is a partition of a sample space, then the probability of an event $B$ can be obtained from the probabilities $P(A_i)$ and $P(B|A_i)$ using the formula
	$P(B)=P(A_1)*P(B|A_1)+...+P(A_n)*P(B|A_n)$
or, we can represent this as a summation,
	$P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)$.

Suppose that the probabilities of events $A_1,...A_n$ are known ($P(A_1),...,P(A_n)$). Note that there is also an event $B$ (in the middle of the graphic), where $P(B|A_1),...P(B|A_n)$ is known but $P(B)$ is unknown.

**Calculation of Posterior Probabilities**

When we have events $A_1,...A_n$, we also have $P(A_1),...,P(A_n)$. We can call these prior probabilities, given that we have the intention of *updating* them given some new information from observing event $B$.

This observation, however you may define it, revises the prior probability of event $A_i$, or $P(A_i)$, into a posterior probability, $P(A_i|B)$, or the probability of event $A_i$ given event $B$. 

Essentially, we wish to update $P(A_i) \rightarrow P(A_i|B)$ since we now have new information on some other event $B$ in the sample space.

This is obtained by Bayes' Theorem, which holds that

$P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)}{\sum_{j} P(B|A_j) \cdot P(A_j)}$

*Ex 1.6.1)*
Suppose it is known that 1% of the population suffers from a particular disease. A blood test has a 97% chance of identifying the disease for diseased individuals, but also has a 6% chance of falsely indicating that a healthy person has the disease.
- What is the probability that a person will have a positive blood test?

*Here we use the law of total probability. First, lay out some of the information we were given.*

$P(disease)=0.01 = P(A_1)$
$P(no~disease) = P'(disease) = 1-0.01=0.99=P(A_2)$
$P(pos.~test|disease) = 0.97=P(B|A_1)$
$P(pos.~test|no~disease) = 0.06=P(B|A_2)$

*Now,* $P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)$, so

$P(B) = (0.97*0.01)+(0.06*0.99)=0.0691$ 

***Hence, $P(pos.~test) = 0.0691$.***

- If your test is positive, what is the probability you have the disease?

*Here we would apply Bayes' theorem. This is because we already have a prior probability of having the disease, or $P(disease)$. Given that we find out about a positive test result, we can update this into $P(disease|pos.~test)$.*

*We know that $P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)}{\sum_{j} P(B|A_j) \cdot P(A_j)}$. So, using the same labeling as earlier,

$P(A_1|B)=\frac{0.97*0.01}{(0.97*0.01)+(0.06*0.99)}=0.1404=P(disease|pos.~test)$
***Hence, $P(disease|pos.~test)=0.1404$***

*Note that the setup is nearly identical to the previous example, where instead we put the sum of products in the denominator with the event of interest as the numerator.*
