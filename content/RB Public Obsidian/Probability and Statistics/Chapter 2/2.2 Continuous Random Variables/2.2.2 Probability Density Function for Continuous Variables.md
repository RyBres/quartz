**Probability Density Function**
Since we don't have known values and therefore probabilities that $X$ may take (as in the case of discrete variables), we must use a range within $X$ to denote the probability we want to find. Hence, to find the probability that a value of $X$ falls between two values $a$ and $b$, we use

$P(a \leq X \leq b)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$

Remember that probability is always $0\leq P\leq1$.

This is the same exact method that we use to find discrete probabilities - it's just hard to notice it. For example, see the probability of rolling a given side of a fair die (the example from [[2.1.2 Probability Mass Function for Discrete Variables]]). The image is reworked into a bar chart (or at least imagine that it is).

If we want to find the probability of rolling a 1 (the highlighted area - doesn't quite line up but again use your imagination), we would know off the bat that $P(2) = 1/6$. In order to integrate, we need to know the  know the probability density function (PDF), or $f(x)$. In this case,

$f(x) = 1/6$

since the PDF simply a straight, horizontal line at $y=1/6$.

When we go to integrate, we find that for $[a,b]=[0,1]$,

$P(0 \leq X \leq 1)=\int_{0}^{1}~1/6~dx=~1/6$ .
