**Cumulative Distribution Function**
The cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable X is defined in exactly the same way as for a discrete random variable, namely

$F(x)=P(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(y)dy$

with the integral portion being when $f(x)$ is known.

Also,

$f(x)=F(x) \frac{d}{dx}$.

We can easily find the probability of some $x$ by

$P(a \leq X \leq b)=P(X \leq b)-P(X' \leq a)=F(b)-F(a)$.
