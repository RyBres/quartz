**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**
Probability mass function is a function that gives the probability that a [discrete random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_random_variable "Discrete random variable") is exactly equal to some value.

For some outcome $x_i$ of a discrete random variable $X$ (remember that $x_i$'s make up $X$), we have that

$0\leq~f(x_i)=P(x_i)\leq1$

where $f(x_i)$ describes the probability of the outcome $x_i$ occurring, which is why I set it equal to $P(x_i)$.

Take a look at example 4 in the textbook. A machine you own can break down for 3 different reasons (events), hence our sample space is composed of

$S=\{electrical, mechanical, misuse\}$.

with each of these outcomes are associated with a different cost of repair. 

Thus, our discrete random variable, or repair cost, is denoted as

$Cost~(dollars)=X=(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(50,200,350)$

with

$P(Cost = 50)=0.3$,
$P(Cost = 200)=0.2$,
$P(Cost = 350)=0.5$.

Note that $\sum_{i=1}^{3}P(x_i)=1$. Note that these probabilities are equal the probability to their respective events (electrical, mechanical, misuse) in the case of machine break down, since each of these costs are exclusive to their events.

We can then graph the PMF as such. An identical PMF can be graphed for the probabilities for the events $\{electrical, mechanical, misuse\}$.
