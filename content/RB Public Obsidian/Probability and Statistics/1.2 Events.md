**Events and Complements**
A subsample of a sample space (i.e., one or more element in the set of possible outcomes - talked about in [[1.1 Probabilities]] notes) is an **event**. 

The **complement** to said event is the probability of anything *but* that event occurring, that is, everything else in the sample space.

*Ex a)*
An event in the sample space for flipping a coin (heads of tails) would be
	 $E=\{(HH)\}$
or perhaps
	 $E=\{(HH),(TT)\}$
where the event in the second event listed is a combined event of getting two heads and two tails.

*Ex b)*
The probability of getting two heads in a row (independent events, unbiased coin) is  $1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4$. What is the complement of this event?
- The complement is calculated with 
	- $1-1/4 = 3/4$

*Ex c)*
Consider the event A that there are no more than two errors in a software product. This event A is given by
- $A = \{0~errors, 1~error, 2~errors\} \in S$
The probability of there being no more than two errors in the software would then be
- $P(\leq2~errors)=P(0)+P(1)+P(2)=0.05+0.08+0.35=0.48$
And the complement would be
- $P(\geq3~errors)=1-0.48=0.52$

*Ex 1.2.3)*
If birthdays are equally likely to fall on any day, what is the probability that a person chosen at random has a birthday in January? What about February?
	*i)* $P(January)=31/365$
	*ii)* $P(February)=28/365$
