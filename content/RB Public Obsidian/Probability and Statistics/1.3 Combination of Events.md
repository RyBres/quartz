Ch. 1.3 [[Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Hayter]]

The combination of events can be modeled several ways, first being the **intersection of two events**. 

**Intersection**
- The event $A\cap B$ is the intersection of the events A and B and consists of the outcomes that are contained within both events A and B.
- The probability of this event, $P(A\cap B)$, is the probability that both events A and B occur simultaneously. 

Generally, $P(A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B)$ and $P(A\cap B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B)$. However, this can be calculated any number of ways depending on what information is given - for intersections, we are interested in the overlapping event spaces of A and B, or any other event in the sample space.

**Unions**
- Refers to when we are interested in the probability of either A or B combined into one event space.

The event $A\cup B$ is the union of events A and B and consists of the outcomes that are contained within at least one of the events A and B. The probability of this event, $P(A\cup B)$, is the probability that at least one of the events A and B occurs.

Generally, $P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$. Remember that this formula can also be rewritten to find the intersection of events A and B (this would be $P(A\cap B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cup B)$).

*Ex 1.3.6)*
If $P(A)= 0.4$ and $P(A\cap B) = 0.3$, what are the possible values for $P(B)$?
- Well, we know that $P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$. From this, we can say that $P(A\cup B) = 0.4+P(B)-0.3=0.1+P(B)$. We know that all probabilities must add to 1 (eventually), however, we don't know whether P(B) is entirely in the event space of P(A), if there are other events in the sample space, etc. So, $0\leq P(B) \leq 0.9$ since the complement of the two known values is 0.9, hence that is the maximum.

*Ex 1.3.7)*
If $P(A)= 0.5$, $P(A\cap B) = 0.1$, and $P(A\cup B) = 0.8$, what is $P(B)$?
- We can fully find $P(B)$ in this problem. We know that $P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$, which gives us $0.8=0.5+P(B)-0.1$. Solving for $P(B)$, we get $P(B)=0.4$.
