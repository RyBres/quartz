**Factorials**
Allows you to count all possible combinations of outcomes given some set of objects. Defined as,
$n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)!$

Also,
$0!=1!=1$

---

**Permutation**
Allows you to count the number of possible outcomes when the order matters for a subset of objects in the given set. Think 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in a set of competitors. Defined as,

$P_k^n=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$

with $n$ being the total number of objects in the set, and $k$ being the total number of objects in the **subset**. For example, in a pool of n=25 competitors, we have k=3 awards we will give out to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners.

---

**Combination**
Gets you the number of combinations of objects in a set given a special subset of objects in the set where order *doesn't matter*. That's a complicated way of saying that there would be 3 equal winners (all get the gold, no particular order in the subset of k=3) in that pool of n=25 competitors.

$C_k^n=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!*k!}$

with $n$ being the total number of objects in the set, and $k$ being the total number of objects in the **subset**.
