Ch. 1.4 [[Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Hayter]]

The probability of an event is said to be **conditional** when the probability of one event affects the other. Generally, $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$ when events A and B are not mutually exclusive.

If events A and B *are* mutually exclusive, then $P(A|B) =\frac{0}{P(B)}=0$, since there is no overlap in the probability space.

If $B \in A$, as in event B is always precluded by event A, then $P(A|B) =\frac{P(B)}{P(B)}=1$. Think of a smaller circle B inside of a larger circle A.
