Ch. 1.1 [[Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Hayter]]

**Sample space**
A **sample space** is a list of all possible outcomes and combinations thereof.

*Ex 1.1.1)*
- If you were to toss a coin twice, what is the sample space?
	- Being that sample spaces is a list of all possible outcomes, i.e., a factorial, this would be
	- $S_{coin}=\{(HH,HT,TT) , (HH,HT,TT)\}$

*Ex 1.1.5*)
- A car repair is performed either on time or late and either satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily. What is the sample space for a car repair?
	- Again, a **factorial** of all outcomes, where
	- $S_{repair}=\{(OT,S),(OT,U),(L,S),(L,U)\}$

**Probabilities**
A set of **probability values** for an experiment with sample space $S=\{O_1,O_2,...,O_n\}$ consists of probabilities $P_1, P_2,...,P_n$ where $0 \leq P_n \leq 1$ and $\sum_{1}^{n} P_n = 1$ .
