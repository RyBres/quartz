Ch. 1.5 [[Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, Hayter]]

**General multiplication law**
It follows from the definition of the conditional probability $P(A|B)$ that the probability of the intersection of two events $A\cap B$ can be calculated as
	$P(A\cap B)=P(B)*P(A|B)$
which is derived from the formula given in [[1.4 Conditional Probability]] notes. 

It is also held that, equally,
	$P(A\cap B)=P(A)*P(B|A)$,
being sure to remember that $P(A\cap B)=P(B\cap A)$.

More generally, since
	$P(C|A\cap B) = \frac{P(C\cap(A\cap B))}{P(A\cap B)}$
the probability of the intersection of three events can be calculated as
	$P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(A\cap B)*P(C|A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B|A)*P(C|A\cap B)$

There are *vastly* more intuitive ways to represent and calculate these probabilities, such as using probability trees. The below example shows when the events are independent, i.e., one outcome does not affect the next.

The example detailed in 1.5.3 in the textbook shows when the events are dependent, where samples are drawn without replacement in a pool of n=500.
