**Continuous Random Variables**
A continuous variable is the other type of random variable, where instead of $x$ being some assigned value for an outcome of an experiment, a continuous variable can take on any value within a given range, whether that be from $49.5 \leq x \leq 50.5$ (so all decimals between those two numbers, which is infinite), or from -$\infty \leq x \leq \infty$.
- Note how instead of $x_i$ to denote a value of $X$ (as in the case of discrete variables), we use $x$ for continuous variables.

The example below should show you the difference between discrete and continuous variables.

This is the same thing as in calculus when we say that $f(x) \in C[a,b]$. Here, our random variable may exist at all points within some interval [a,b].

*Ask ChatGPT: What are the properties of a **continuous** random variable?*

1. **Uncountable Outcomes:** A continuous random variable is one whose possible values are uncountable. This means there are infinitely many possible outcomes within a range or interval.
    
2. **Probability Density Function (PDF):** For a continuous random variable, the probability distribution is described by a probability density function (PDF), which specifies the likelihood of the random variable falling within a particular interval.
    
3. **Infinite Possible Values:** Continuous random variables can take on an infinite number of values within a given interval. For example, the height of a person can be any value within a certain range.
    
4. **No Gaps Between Values:** There are no distinct gaps between possible values. In a continuous distribution, any value within a range is a possible outcome.
    
5. **Probability Distribution:** The probability distribution is described by a probability density function (PDF), which gives the relative likelihood of different outcomes rather than the exact probabilities.
    
6. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Continuous random variables have a cumulative distribution function (CDF) that describes the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

*Ex)*
Some measurements from nature are good examples of continuous variables.

One example would be the diameter of a tree trunk. We know that there is some reasonable range that these could exist (say, $0~feet<x<200~feet$ or something like that), but when it comes to taking measurements (our experiment in this case would be finding the diameter of $n$ trees), we only know that they can fall anywhere in that interval.

So, $trunk~diameter=X$. Our measurements might be $16.1234...$ for the first tree then $11.5193...$ for the second, and so on.
