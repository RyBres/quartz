**Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)**
The intuition for the CDF is very similar to the PMF (probability mass function), but imposes one more condition upon the function. Instead of the PMF's
	$f(x_i)=P(x_i)$,

we have
	$F(x_i)=P(x\leq~x_i)$.

In this case, we are interested in the probability of the random variable $X$ being less than or equal to $x_i$ for a given $i$. You don't need to denote any of this in terms of $i$, although that does allow you to show which value in the set $X$ you're referring to (indexing).

*Ex)*
Here, we see a PMF for a six-sided die.

Instead of showing the probability for each given value, we instead just add the probabilities as we move along the x-axis. Hence, the PMF will look something like this, with each black dot adding $1/6$ to the accumulated $P$:

You can also draw a line through the points and shade the region below (referring to the example in class), but to be honest, it might be best to keep the stair-step look for *discrete* variables as the probability only accumulates at exactly $x_i$, not the space, say, between $x_i$ and $x_{i-1}$ or $x_{i+1}$.
