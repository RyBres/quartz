**Discrete Random Variable**
A random variable is obtained by assigning a numerical value to each outcome of a particular experiment. Discrete implies that the numerical values that may be assigned to the outcomes are finite. A discrete number would, for example, be the number of fingers on your hand (even if $\#~fingers=0$), which is $5$ for most people and could not possibly be $\infty$.

Though I suppose you could make the argument that you if you could have $1/2$ of a finger, then $\#~fingers \in C[0,5]$ (i.e., the number of fingers is *continuous* on the interval from 0 to 5, since we are then accepting fractions between any given integer), but ignore that for now.

*Ex)*
Say we are flipping a coin two times in a row, with $S=\{(HH), (HT), (TH), (TT)\}$ being the sample space containing all possible outcomes (four objects total). In this game, we add one point each time we get a heads. So, the random variable in question (or, outcome variable), would be the number of points we have, or $X=\#~of~points$, where $X\in[0,2]$.

*Ask ChatGPT: What are the properties of a **discrete** random variable?*

1. **Countable Outcomes:** A discrete random variable is one whose possible values are countable. This means there is either a finite number of possible outcomes or a countably infinite number of outcomes.
2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** For a discrete random variable, the probability distribution is described by a probability mass function (PMF), which assigns a probability to each possible value that the random variable can take.
3. **Specific Values:** Discrete random variables can only take on specific values. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
4. **Gaps Between Values:** There are distinct gaps between each possible value. For example, in the case of a six-sided die, there are no values between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.
5. **Probability Distribution:** The probability distribution is described by a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability of each possible outcome.
6. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** Discrete random variables also have a cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.
