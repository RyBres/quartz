The expectation of a discrete random variable is simply a weighted average of the *values* in a probability - weighted by the values' corresponding probabilities.

This is denoted by
$E(X)=\sum_{i} p_i*x_i=p_1*x_1+...+p_n*x_n$.

*Ex)*
Refer to the repair cost example from section [[2.1.2 Probability Mass Function for Discrete Variables]], where we have three different outcomes for our cost variable $X$ ($50, $200, $350), which correspond to a different outcomes/probabilities in sample space $S$, which are shown below.

$P(electrical)=0.3$
$P(mechanical)=0.2$
$P(misuse)=0.5$

Hence, we say that the expected value is

$E(X=repair~cost)=0.3*50+0.2*200+0.5*350=15+40+175=230$
