The median of a continuous random variable is when the CDF, of $F(X)=0.5$. This is just another way of saying the "middle number".

For a discrete random variable, the median will be defined the same, where $F(X)=0.5$. However, if there is a tie (i.e., even number of $x$'s), then the median is $(min+max)/2$.
