The expectation of a continuous random variable is found by using 
$E(X)=\int_{state~space} x*f(x)$

where $f(x)$ is the probability distribution function.

Remember that for discrete variables, $f(x)$ can be a $p$ for a given $x_i$. Since a continuous variable is, well, continuous, then its probability is continuous as well (which would be a function).

*Ex)*
A metal cylinder being produced can have a diameter within 49.5 cm and 50.5 cm. Its probability distribution function is given as
$f(x)=1.5-6(x-50.0)^2$

Hence,
$E(X)=\int_{49.5}^{50.5}x*(1.5-6(x-50.0)^2)$

Then simplify and solve ($F(b)-F(a)$ and all that).
