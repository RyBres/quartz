The variance of a random variable $X$ is denoted as
$\sigma^2=var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2$.

Remember that for a **discrete variable**,
$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i*p(x_i)$

and for a **continuous variable**,
$E(X)=\int_{state~space}x*f(x)~dx$

where $f(x)$ is the probability distribution function (which is given in any problem, so don't worry about that).

The standard deviation is given by
$\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^2}=\sqrt{var(X)}$.
