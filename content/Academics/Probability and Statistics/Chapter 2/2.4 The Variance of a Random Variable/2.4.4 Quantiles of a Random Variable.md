This is merely an extension of what we learned in [[2.3.3 Medians of Random Variables]]. A particular quantile $p$ (noting that the 0.5 quantile, or median, is $p=0.5$) of a random variable, is found with
$F(X)=p$.

So, for example, the 70th quantile of X would translate to $p=0.70$. In that case, you would set the cumulative distribution function $F(X)=0.70$ and solve.

For the sake of definitions, the upper quartile is when $p=0.75$, middle quartile is median, and lower quartile is $p=0.25$. 

The **interquartile range** is simply the upper quantile minus the lower quantile.
