Chebyshev's inequality looks daunting, but given the correct information, it's simply just plugging and chugging.

Chebyshev's theorem states that a certain proportion of data (in a set) falls within a range around the mean value $\mu$ given some standard deviation $\sigma$. Written as

$P(\mu -c\sigma \leq X \leq \mu +c\sigma) \geq 1-\frac{1}{c^2}$.

It's easier to see this in practice. See below.

*Ex)*

You work a part-time job, with a maximum of 500 hours worked per period.

Across the company, the average ($\mu$) is 300 hours, with a standard deviation ($\sigma$) of 50 hours.

What's the probability that one works between 200 and 400 hours for a period?

*Note that the first bit of info about 500 hours is irrelevant. Given the $\sigma$ and $\mu$, we can assemble the inequality. We already have the bounds of 200 and 400, so let's insert them in there too for computation.*

$P(200=300-c*50 \leq X \leq 300+c*50=400)$

*Solving for C, we find that* $c=2$.

*So, moving to the right side of the inequality,*

$P(200\leq X \leq 400) \geq 1- \frac{1}{2^2} = 1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$.
